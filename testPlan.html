<h1>Homeaglow Purchase Flow Test Plan</h1>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Ensure a seamless customer journey from clicking the ad to scheduling an appointment on
    Homeaglow.</p>
<p><strong>Scope:</strong> Includes ad click redirection, website interactions, and purchase completion.</p>

<h2>2. Test Items</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Ad Redirection Functionality</li>
    <li>Eligibility Check based on Zip Code</li>
    <li>Voucher Selection and Purchase Process</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Features to be Tested</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Redirection from various advertising platforms to the Homeaglow website</li>
    <li>Interactive elements and information accuracy on the deals page</li>
    <li>User information input validation and functionality</li>
    <li>Payment processing with multiple methods</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Features Not to be Tested</h2>

    <li>Emails/texts - these are blocked on staging and don't need to be included.</li>
    <li>Apple+Google Pay</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Testing Approach</h2>
<h3>Functional Testing</h3>
<p>This involves verifying the functionalities of the website according to the requirements. It includes testing all user interactions, data processing, and validations within the purchase flow.</p>
<p>Test cases:</p>

<h3>Usability Testing</h3>
<p>Focuses on the user experience to ensure the website is intuitive and easy to navigate. This includes assessing the design, layout, and overall user journey through the purchase process.</p>

<h3>Performance Testing</h3>
<p>Ensures that the website performs well under various conditions. This includes testing load times, responsiveness, and the website's ability to handle a high volume of users simultaneously.</p>

<h3>Accessibility Testing</h3>
<p>Checks the website's compliance with accessibility standards to ensure it is usable by people with disabilities. This includes testing for screen reader compatibility, color contrast, and keyboard navigation.</p>

<h3>Cross-Browser and Device Compatibility</h3>
<p>The selection of browsers and devices is based on the target user demographic and popular usage statistics. We aim to cover a diverse range of platforms to ensure the majority of our users have a seamless experience.</p>
<p>Desktop Browsers: Latest version of Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge.</p>
<p>Mobile Browsers: Safari on iOS and Google Chrome on Android. We will test on the latest and previous versions of iOS and Android.</p>
<p>Devices: Desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices.</p>
<p>Browser Settings: enabling/disabling JavaScript</p>

<h3>Test Automation</h3>
<p>We will utilize the Playwright framework with TypeScript for automated testing to cover  the most common and high-impact user journeys, repetitive and regression testing, data validation, and high-level performance testing.</p>
